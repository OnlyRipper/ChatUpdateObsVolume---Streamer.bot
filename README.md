# Update specific Audio Source volume using Twitch chat.

## Powered by ⭐ [streamerbot.com ](https://streamer.bot/) ⭐

🔘 This works (kinds of) well with my volume widget: https://github.com/OnlyRipper/OBS-Volume-Widget-Streamer.Bot | If you use both add a "Run Ation" in the Sub-Actions at the end to also trigger the widget!
*As for now the widget won't show more than 100% if boosted over!*

🔘 The command works by specifying the name and the volume:
* ex: !volume game 70 (this will aproximate a lower the volume in OBS with 3.1 db)

*The reason why it may look weird how it updates is because at -20db to -30db is already way too low to go even lower!*

* ex: !volume game 110 (this will boost with 10 the volume in OBS, maximum 125 in chat)
